            You can get involved with Naatak in a number of ways. Being a part of Naatak requires no prior experience in theatre or otherwise. We will teach you how to do anything you sign up for!<br><br>

            		<h4>Join the Cast</h4>
            		Come audition for our next show. We typically have auditions within the first couple of weeks of each semester, the same time as other Theatre Arts Council (TAC-E) groups. You can and should audition for them as well.<br>
            		Auditioning involves showing up for just 5 to 10 minutes in the time they are being held. We will give you any sides you need for your audition.<br>
            		If you have never acted before or have acted only once long ago in middle school, you have no reason to worry. A lot of the current members of the theatre community at Penn acted in their first show at Penn.

            		<h4>Be part of the Technical Crew</h4>
            		Don't think acting is for you? You might find what you love in the technical side of things.<br>
            		At Naatak, we take tech as seriously as we do acting. You can design lights, sounds, sets, costumes, props, graphic, or you can be the master carpenter and build our set!<br>
            		Never done any of those things before? Not to worry, we'll teach you how things are done and you can always be part of one of the crews to learn from more experienced designers.<br>
            		We hold tech interviews the week after acting auditions and all you need to do is to stop by for 5 minutes to say hi and tell us what you're interested in.

            		<h4>Run the Marketing and Ad Campaign</h4>
            		More into business, engineering, or content creation? We still would love you to join. PenNaatak's marketing and ad campaign is a great place to get your hands dirty.<br>
            		You can help us get advertisements from local and other businesses, run our marketing campaign, design and maintain our website, and create writing, photo, and video content for our blog and social media.<br>
            		These are things that we can teach you as well, so if your focus is more pre-professional, this is an awesome chance for you to learn and put your ideas into practice. All you need to do is drop by for tech interviews.

            		<h4>Direct your own show</h4>
            		Naatak is a great platform to express creativity on all levels. All our shows are student directed and we would love to help your ideas come to life on stage.<br>
            		You can propose to direct to PenNaatak if you have a flair for theatre, have a strong vision, and would like to put on a show which is in any way related to South Asia.<br>
            		We begin accepting directors proposals the previous semester from when you wish to direct, usually after the show for the semester ends. Feel free to chat with any of the board members if you're interested.

            		<h4>Become a Board Member</h4>
            		Lastly, if you just love Naatak, have been involved in a show in the past 3 semesters, and want to have a say in selecting plays, directors, and the production process, come out and join our board.<br>
            		Board elections happen every Spring towards the end of the semester and a newly elected board will be in-charge for a year after that Spring semester.<br>
            		Although the board is a flat board, you are elected to various positions. These include Chair, Vice Chair, Technical Director, Creative Director, Treasuerer, Outreach Coordinator, and Secretary. Feel free to chat with anyone on the current board to talk about these positions.
