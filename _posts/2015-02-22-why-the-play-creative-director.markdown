#Nikhil Venkatesa


![Nikhil Venkatesa](http://pennaataktheatre.com/images/nikhil.jpg)

#####1. Who are you? What is your position on the Board? What does that even mean?

*I’m Nikhil Venkatesa, Creative Director extraordinaire. I’m a sophomore in the College studying English and Political Science.*



#####2. What are your interests outside of Naatak?

*I recently founded a film club on campus called Penn Cinema Initiative (PCI), which focuses on the study and appreciation of film and the practice of filmmaking. You should join! Seriously though, I’ve been organizing screenings and watching them myself. I also review movies for 34th Street.*



#####3. Why did you like The Who and The What? What makes it stand out from other plays?
*I loved TW&TW because it discusses religion in a frank way that respects Islam but doesn’t elevate it or try to be politically correct around it. Ayad Akhtar brings so many ideas to the table that even though the content of the play might seem provocative, he deflects it with sharp wit and humor. It’s a play fit for the modern age, where everyone, especially Penn kids is self-aware about most things.*



#####4. What are you most looking forward to in the production?

*I look forward to Crew Review so I can rip the play apart and not have to feel guilty about it.*



#####5. If you were an app what would you be and why?

*The Inception Button on loop. Loud, annoying, and never stops. Also movies.*
