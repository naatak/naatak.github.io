Ahmed Mohieldin
===============

#####**1. Who are you? What is your position on the Board? What does that even mean?**
*On board I’m tech director, but this semester I’m the Show Convener, which means that I’m responsible for, well, everything! I make sure that everything happens when it needs to so that come March 27 & 28, we have a show.*

#####**2. What are your interests outside of Naatak?**
*I do a lot of other theatre stuff - I’ve worked on 11 shows since coming to Penn and I’m the newly elected Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e) Chair! I’m also on the governing board of my fraternity (Phi Psi!). When the weather is warmer, you can often find me sitting ouside somewhere and people watching.*

#####**3. Why did you like The Who and The What? What makes it stand out from other plays?**
*I’m really intrigued by how it looks at Islam - not as an absolute good or an absolute evil, but as something that should be looked at critically (for better or worse).*

#####**4. What are you most looking forward to in the production?**
*Everything! My job is to help put all the different pieces together, so every step towards the end is exciting.*

#####**5. If you were an app what would you be and why?**
*Ooft, probably an app where you open it and it picked three random people, strangers or friends, for you to run into, because that’s a pretty apt description of how my social life works.*
