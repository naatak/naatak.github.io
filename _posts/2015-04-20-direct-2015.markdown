> Naatak makes you move from in front of the stage to behind it, and that experience is a trial of fire out of which your understanding of theatre shifts dramatically.


> There is a surprising amount of freedom with Naatak, not only to put forth your vision, but to experiment with it. You can practice being a director,  instead of just pretending to be a professional already.
