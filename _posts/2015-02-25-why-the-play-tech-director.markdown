Rohan Bhide
===========

#####**1. Who are you? What is your position on the Board? What does that even mean?**
*Rohan Bhide, tech and theater virtuoso and the integral cog in the Naatak machine without whom things start to fall apart. Also, a freshman in Engineering in the NETS program.*



#####**2. What are your interests outside of Naatak?**
*Shreshth doesn't let people have interests outside Naatak.*



#####**3. Why did you like The Who and The What? What makes it stand out from other plays?**
*Ayad Akhtar has written a fiery new play that challenges old misconceptions and revolves around identity, religion and contradictions, making us ponder who we really are.*



#####**4. What are you most looking forward to in the production?**
*The Load-In week when everyone reports to the Show's Tech Director (a.k.a me). Yes, I'm a power-hungry and despotic individual. I guess I should have mentioned that earlier.*



#####**5. If you were an app what would you be and why?**
*The Moron test. It makes you feel like a moron. Oh right, I'm also narcissistic.*
