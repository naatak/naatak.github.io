Pallavi Surana
==============

#####**1. Who are you? What is your position on the Board? What does that even mean?**
*My name is Pallavi Surana and I am Vice Chair of PenNaatak, UPenn's premier South Asian theater group. Well, I'm still trying to figure that out but I basically deal with lots of administrative stuff and selling the show out!*

#####**2. What are your interests outside of Naatak?**
*Eating. Eating, and... Eating.*

#####**3. Why did you like The Who and The What? What makes it stand out from other plays?**
*The playwright's main point is to show how contemporary Islam is a summary of the interpretation of religious texts like the Koran, and how these stories ultimately become fact. I like this play because it uses a simple example to portray how the Prophet Mohammed is an imagined reality - he is who we (religious leaders etc.) say he is rather than who he really was. Just as Zarina is writing a somewhat fictional account of Mohammed, others like her father create stories or misrepresent Koranic passages to defend their decisions and/or justify their commands. Anyone who sees this connection sees the beauty of the play, and the subtle power of Zarina's writing.*

#####**4. What are you most looking forward to in the production?**
*Tech (hell) week. But seriously, I am.*

#####**5. If you were an app what would you be and why?**
*Google Maps. So I never lose my bearings.*
