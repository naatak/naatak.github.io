Fall 2015 Acting Auditions
==========================

We're beginning a new year and kicking off a new show. 

**WE WANT YOU** to be a part of it. Come act for Naatak! Auditions are being held on Sunday 8/30 and Monday 8/31 from 8 PM to 11:59 PM on the first floor of Williams Hall. 

For those of you who haven't done this before, you can act for Naatak regardless of your past acting experience. Some of our most awesome actors (who are now on our board) had never been on stage before! You don't have to prepare and all you have to do is drop by for 10 minutes.

If you have any questions, leave a comment below :)
