PenNaatak's Executive Board
===========================

#####**1. Who are you? What is your position on the Board? What does that even mean?**
*I’m Monisha and I’m the treasurer, meaning that I (hopefully) make sure we have enough money to do all the things we need and want to do for each show.*

#####**2. What are your interests outside of Naatak?**
*Being outside- skiing in the winter and cycling in the summer! I also enjoy tennis, but the infamous Seattle drizzle means I’ve always considered that an indoor sport.*

#####**3. Why did you like The Who and The What? What makes it stand out from other plays?**
*I love the way it takes a nuanced approach to oftentimes dichotomized issues, encouraging all of us to become more intellectually curious and to question even those things we might think we know.*

#####**4. What are you most looking forward to in the production?**
*Hell week! We might complain in the moment but it’s also a lot of fun!*

#####**5. If you were an app what would you be and why?**
*The Chipotle app--love of food is a trend on this board.*
