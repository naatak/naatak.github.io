		  PenNaatak is a theatre group at the University of Pennsylvania. We are commonly referred to as Naatak, and perform two plays a year: one during the fall semester and the other in the spring. The plays we perform have a South Asian flavor to them in terms of style, issues dealt with, characters, or nationality of the playwright.
